Problem Statement:A college needs to develop a system to allocate Open Elective Subjects to its respective students. The way the system would work is that each student is allowed 5 choices with the respective preference, where number 1 indicates the first preference, number 2 indicates second preference and so on,the subjects are supposed tobe allotted on the basis of the Studentâ€™s GPA, which means the student with the students with the highest GPAs are allotted the subject they want. Every subject has a limited number of seats so if a subject has 60 seatsand all of them are filled then the student would not be allotted his first preference but instead second would be checked,if the second preference is full as well then the third preference would be checked, this process would be repeated till the student is allotted a subjectof his/her choice. If in case all the preferences that the student has selected are already full, then the student would be considered as unallotted and would be marked so.For example, Mohit has filled his 5 choices with the respective preferences and they are as following:The below table has the subject to student mapping with the preference

Note:StudentId and SubjectId are foreign keys in this table.
Constraints: A single Student cannot select the same subject twice. 

(Table Name: StudentPreference)
StudentId SubjectId Preference
159103036 PO1491 1
159103036 PO1492 2
159103036 PO1493 3
159103036 PO1494 4
159103036 PO1495 5

The below table has the details of subjects such as Subject Id, Subject name,and the maximum number of seats
Note: SubjectId is the primary key for this table

(Table Name: SubjectDetails)
SubjectId SubjectName MaxSeats RemainingSeats
PO1491 Basics of Political Science 60 2
PO1492 Basics of Accounting 120 119
PO1493 Basics of Financial Markets 90 90
PO1494 Eco philosophy 60 50
PO1495 Automotive Trends 60 60

The below table has the student Details such as StudentId, StudentName, GPA and their Branch:
Note: StudentId is the primary key for this table

(Table Name: StudentDetails)
StudentId StudentName GPA Branch Section
159103036 Mohit Agarwal 8.9 CCE A
159103037 Rohit Agarwal 5.2 CCE A
159103038 Shohit Garg 7.1 CCE B
159103039 Mrinal Malhotra 7.9 CCE A
159103040 Mehreet Singh 5.6 CCE A
159103041 Arjun Tehlan 9.2 CCE B

Final Resultant Table if the student has been allotted to a subject:

(Table Name: Allotments)
SubjectId StudentId
PO1491 159103036

Final Resultant Table if the student is unallotted:

(Table Name: UnallotedStudents)
StudentId
159103036

Your Task is to write a Stored Procedure to assign all the studentsto a respective subjectaccording the above stated workflow.
